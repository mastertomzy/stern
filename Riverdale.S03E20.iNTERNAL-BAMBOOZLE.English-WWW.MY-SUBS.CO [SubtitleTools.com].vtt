00:00:00.977 --> 00:00:03.158
Previously on Riverdale...

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.489
Kurtz!

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:05.987
What the hell?

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:10.175
I'm willing to sell
the Whyte Wyrm to you

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.398
in exchange for Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:13.775
It's about Jason.

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:15.862
The Farm gave me back my brother.

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:17.364
Edgar Evernever decided

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:20.127
he wants to adopt the
twins after he marries Mom.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.447
Now, that can't happen.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.139
I wonder, Betty, if you would
consider doing me a favor as well.

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:27.073
Your dad and a few other inmates

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:29.847
were being transported
to my father's prison,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.995
and there was some kind of accident.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.636
There were no survivors.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.935
Mr. Jones, what happened here?

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.198
We don't know the answer to
that yet. We're working on it.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.323
It's him.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.461
He's back, the Black Hood.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:29.907
Betty's dad was on that bus.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.977
He was being transferred
to Hiram's prison.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.229
He's out there, Mr. Jones.

00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:36.066
No, no. Betty.

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.069
No one survived this crash, I'm...

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:39.932
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:42.542
You know that he's dead?

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:44.086
You're positive?

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:46.223
There were five inmates
on that bus, one driver,

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:48.146
that's six in total, which is...

00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:52.177
It's the number of heads we've found.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.579
DNA tests will confirm it if we can't
piece everyone back together, but...

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:58.073
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:03.538
Betty, we should go.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.444
He asked for my help with this transfer.

00:02:06.447 --> 00:02:08.368
He wanted this, Veronica.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.930
What if he planned
this? What if he escaped?

00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:14.224
He could still be out there.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.631
Archie?

00:02:22.634 --> 00:02:23.845
Mom.

00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:27.028
Oh...

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.804
I would've picked you
up from the airport,

00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:29.973
but Dad took his truck,

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:31.683
and I'm not sure the
jalopy's your speed.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.149
Oh, that's fine. I took an Uber.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.294
But have you had breakfast yet?

00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:35.746
We can go to Pop's, my treat.

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.572
Actually, can we do dinner instead?

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.466
I was gonna head to the
gym before school starts.

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:41.624
Yeah, your dad mentioned
that you'd taken up boxing.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.252
Said you're pretty serious about it.

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:45.017
I am, yeah.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.300
That's not why you came,
is it? To talk me out of it?

00:02:47.303 --> 00:02:48.336
Not at all.

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.353
Things were slow in Chicago, and I just
wanted to spend some time with my son.

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:53.054
- That's all.
- Ah.

00:02:53.057 --> 00:02:55.608
What, have you come to
steal more babies, Elizabeth?

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.810
No, I came to warn you that
Dad might be on the loose.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:01.413
FP already called.
There were no survivors.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.957
Well, Dr. Curdle Jr. hasn't
identified the bodies yet,

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.320
so we don't know that.

00:03:05.323 --> 00:03:08.161
And this is what I mean
about letting go of your past.

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:11.414
Stop indulging in these morbid delusions

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:14.576
that your serial killer of a
father is somehow still alive.

00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:18.931
Did you get a tattoo?

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.883
Yes.

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:23.936
Edgar asked me to get it.

00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:26.098
I like to think of it
as an engagement ring.

00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:28.723
How are you feeling?

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.401
You mean, considering
that Mom abandoned me?

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:36.657
She didn't abandon you.

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:42.028
Actually, Mom leaving town is probably
the most selfless thing she's ever done.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.110
I've never lived anywhere without her.

00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:47.209
Well, I'm glad you decided to stay.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.862
Just no more playing G&G, okay?

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.173
Why is everyone so freaked out about it?

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:56.972
It's just pretend quests and costumes.

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:58.187
Who was in costume?

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.630
Well, Ricky had those
ears and I had a crown,

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:04.601
and the Gargoyle King, of course.

00:04:06.338 --> 00:04:08.564
Wait, you met the Gargoyle King?

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.715
Like, in person? What happened?

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.175
He gave me and Ricky a quest.

00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:13.177
You talked to him?

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:15.253
What did he say?

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:16.947
Said that I couldn't enter the Kingdom.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.699
Not until I have the Gospel.

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.941
That was our next quest.

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:21.285
"The Gospel."

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.686
What's the Gospel?

00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:25.622
I don't know. We never found it.

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:28.566
But Ricky said that the Gospel

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:31.044
is where the Gargoyle
King keeps all his secrets.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.383
Good morning, boys.

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:38.552
And good news, Archie.

00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:40.245
I've got your fight application.

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:41.388
What are you talking about?

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.538
For the Regional Classic.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.496
Nice.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.041
That's a hot tournament.
How'd you get him in?

00:04:45.043 --> 00:04:47.085
I'm very persuasive when I need to be.

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:48.063
You'll be ready.

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:49.804
You just got to get your
mom or dad to sign off on it

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.225
so we can make the deadline.

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:54.761
This is the perfect opportunity
to jump-start your boxing career.

00:04:54.764 --> 00:04:58.373
Hey, if you ever want to add
another client to your roster,

00:04:58.376 --> 00:04:59.889
I'd love to have a manager like you.

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:02.192
I'll think about it, Mad Dog.

00:05:02.194 --> 00:05:04.819
Guys, Old Faithful just
opened up in the locker room.

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:06.914
I think a pipe burst.
I turned the water off,

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:09.324
but someone should go
take a look at that.

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:10.784
I'll fix it.

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:12.235
What, suddenly you're a plumber?

00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:13.717
- Bring in a professional.
- Ronnie.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.072
I've actually been meaning to talk
to you, Archie. As your manager.

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:20.669
This gym has charm to spare,
but it could use an update.

00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:21.586
A little sprucing up.

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:23.121
With what money, Ronnie?

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:24.522
Mine.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:27.174
I'd like to invest in you and your gym.

00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:29.085
La Bonne Nuit has been
doing very well lately,

00:05:29.087 --> 00:05:32.013
and I wouldn't mind
diversifying my portfolio

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:34.095
to include a property on the Southside.

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:37.194
Can't be a coincidence.

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:38.536
He asked for the transfer,

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:42.002
and then his bus just burst into flames?

00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:46.101
He planned it. He used me to
escape, and now he's out there.

00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:48.121
Betty, I was with you.

00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:50.440
I saw what was left of that bus.

00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:51.691
Nobody could've survived that.

00:05:51.693 --> 00:05:52.984
Yeah, but if he did...

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:56.463
If he did, you've got
me, you have the Serpents,

00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:58.465
you have Archie and
his fight-club buddies.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:01.409
You have a veritable
armada here to protect you.

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:03.786
Also, you can move back
in with my dad and I.

00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:05.872
It's been a lot quieter
since my mom's been gone.

00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:08.717
Mmm, I'm sorry that she left, Jug.

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.626
How's JB doing after all this?

00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:12.170
Shockingly well.

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:14.039
And she's filled in some key blanks.

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:17.387
Apparently, there's a Gospel of the
Gargoyle King out there somewhere.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.565
Could be important.

00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:20.653
My dad's been sweeping
Junkyard Steve's...

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:24.140
Sorry to interrupt your no
doubt thrilling catch-up, chums,

00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:27.235
but, as you know, junior
prom is this weekend.

00:06:27.237 --> 00:06:28.662
The theme is Fire and Ice,

00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:30.980
and, naturally, Toni
and I are campaigning

00:06:30.982 --> 00:06:33.649
to be the most captivating prom
queens this school's ever seen.

00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.911
So it goes without saying,
vote Choni for co-monarchs

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:39.489
because, when you really think about it,

00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:41.049
no other options make sense.

00:06:42.827 --> 00:06:45.178
Prom is this weekend?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.014
We still do things like that here?

00:06:47.016 --> 00:06:48.223
I mean, apparently.

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:51.077
Jug...

00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:54.855
Will you go to prom with me?

00:06:54.857 --> 00:06:56.714
Only for you, Betty Cooper.

00:07:10.688 --> 00:07:12.781
Hey, peanut butter and banana.

00:07:12.783 --> 00:07:15.358
Thought you might be
hungry, ready for a break.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.026
Definitely.

00:07:17.028 --> 00:07:19.470
Actually, Mom, I wanted
to ask you something.

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.863
There's a tournament this
weekend that I want to box in,

00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:22.770
the Regional Classic.

00:07:22.773 --> 00:07:24.885
I just need you to sign my
application to let me compete.

00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:26.111
Archie...

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.796
Let me guess. You don't want me to box.

00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:30.915
I didn't even want you to play football.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:34.008
And boxing is so much more brutal.

00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:37.513
I'm behind on everything
else, but I'm good at boxing.

00:07:37.516 --> 00:07:39.066
I was actually thinking about going pro.

00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:40.788
Going pro?

00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:43.136
Archie, I know you've been
dealing with a lot lately...

00:07:43.138 --> 00:07:46.448
- Mom.
- But I won't support you getting pummeled.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.741
The range is closing.
Please return your gear.

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:13.082
Dr. Curdle Jr.

00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:14.843
Ms. Cooper, hello.

00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:16.442
Have you identified the bodies?

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:18.920
The corpses were charred
beyond recognition.

00:08:18.923 --> 00:08:22.350
But I was able to work
with one semi-intact hand,

00:08:22.352 --> 00:08:26.471
and it matches your father,
DNA and fingerprints.

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:28.431
It's him, Ms. Cooper.

00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:31.618
For good or ill, your father is dead.

00:08:45.454 --> 00:08:48.923

00:08:58.123 --> 00:08:59.773
Hey, Dad, have you seen Jellybean?

00:08:59.776 --> 00:09:01.290
I dropped her off at school. Listen.

00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:02.548
I'm at Junkyard Steve's.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.008
You better get down here and see this.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.136
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:19.407
Since this is where Kurtz brought you

00:09:19.409 --> 00:09:21.168
and where he was killed
by the Gargoyle King,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.795
me and my men have been
doing a sweep of the junkyard.

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:25.902
It led us to this bus.

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:35.665
Looks like this is where Kurtz...

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:37.767
and some other Gargoyles were crashing.

00:09:57.956 --> 00:09:59.122
The Gospel.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.140
Veronica.

00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:16.747
Uh, my mom signed.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.249
I can enter the Regional Classic.

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:19.917
And not a moment too soon.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.637
We can submit it now and get
it in just under the deadline.

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:23.767
Awesome.

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.692
Are you sure about this?

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:29.477
I love seeing you back in the ring,

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:32.054
but if the tournament's too
soon, we can send Mad Dog.

00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:33.931
You can keep training and go next year.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:34.932
I'm ready.

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:37.327
It's just, um, I was wondering...

00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:40.914
What are you doing for prom?

00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:43.836
- Prom?
- Yeah, I thought maybe we could go together.

00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:46.329
As friends.

00:10:47.497 --> 00:10:49.339
I would honestly love that.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.658
Yeah? Great.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.620
- Great.
- Prom tickets here!

00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:58.456
Get your prom tickets here.

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.684
Uh, actually, we'll take two, please.

00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:02.936
Well, well, well.

00:11:02.938 --> 00:11:05.555
What was off is now back on again.

00:11:05.557 --> 00:11:07.089
You owe me a cherry phosphate.

00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:08.341
We're just going as friends.

00:11:08.343 --> 00:11:09.246
Hmm.

00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:11.777
- In fact, we'll be paying separately.
- Whatever.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.971
Just remember to vote
Choni for prom queens, okay?

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.282
Thanks. Bye.

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:20.537
Cheryl, what are you doing?

00:11:20.539 --> 00:11:22.530
Campaigning for prom queen
is strictly forbidden.

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:24.457
"Forbidden"? What's up with that?

00:11:24.459 --> 00:11:25.656
The Farm prohibits it

00:11:25.659 --> 00:11:28.378
because it goes against
our strictures of equality.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.830
Remember, "The one become
many, the many, one"?

00:11:30.832 --> 00:11:32.582
Easy for you to say, Evelyn.

00:11:32.584 --> 00:11:34.325
Aren't you, like, 30?

00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:35.668
How many proms have you been to?

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.836
This is a test.

00:11:36.838 --> 00:11:38.574
You can either be queens for one night,

00:11:38.577 --> 00:11:41.457
or you can live in the glory
of the Farm for all of eternity.

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:42.792
Which would you prefer?

00:11:42.794 --> 00:11:44.728
Honestly, both.

00:11:55.807 --> 00:11:59.047
There's a lot of mythical
stuff in this Gospel, Betty.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.354
The Gargoyles were
thought to be evil spirits

00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:05.981
that lived in the
clouds, preying on people.

00:12:05.983 --> 00:12:08.607
So the Gryphon Queen
turned them to stone.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.178
They fell from the Kingdom and
shattered when they hit the earth.

00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:12.738
Jug...

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.917
All this lore builds
up the Gargoyle King

00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:18.661
to be some kind of
supernatural creature,

00:12:18.663 --> 00:12:20.847
but this guy is just a serial killer.

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.499
Just like my dad.

00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.593
The Black Hood was flesh and blood,

00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:27.228
and so is the Gargoyle King.

00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:31.217
Which means...

00:12:34.363 --> 00:12:35.818
That he can die.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.276
Betty, if you need a couple days,

00:12:42.278 --> 00:12:43.674
you can take a break.

00:12:43.677 --> 00:12:46.706
No. I need to keep moving.

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:49.876
I just want this to end.

00:12:54.466 --> 00:12:55.840
It's Dr. Curdle Jr.

00:12:57.127 --> 00:12:59.602
He's got results from
Kurtz's autopsy for us.

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:06.250
Hey, Archie, could I
talk to you for a sec?

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.302
Yeah, sure. What's up?

00:13:08.304 --> 00:13:11.472
I know you're upset with me that I
wouldn't let you enter the tournament.

00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:14.734
And believe it or not, I'm really happy
that you found something that you love.

00:13:14.736 --> 00:13:15.985
I do love it, Mom.

00:13:16.613 --> 00:13:17.926
Well, listen.

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:20.973
I called a recruiter from the
Naval Academy, old friend of mine,

00:13:20.976 --> 00:13:23.434
and they have an amazing boxing program.

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:24.685
Even scholarships.

00:13:24.687 --> 00:13:26.996
So, you could box and get an education.

00:13:28.357 --> 00:13:29.991
Will you at least talk to her?

00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:32.502
Sure, Mom. Of course.

00:13:33.154 --> 00:13:34.254
Thanks.

00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:38.258
Judging by the healing,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.502
I'd say Mr. Kurtz got
these tattoos last month.

00:13:41.504 --> 00:13:46.582
Yet again, the same symbols that were
carved into Ben, Dilton, and Baby Teeth.

00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:48.584
Well, the Gospel says that
you need these markings

00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:50.328
in order to be sent to the Kingdom.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.756
Maybe these tattoos are Kurtz's
way of trying to slip his way in.

00:13:53.758 --> 00:13:56.798
Jug, whoever gave him these
tattoos could be a new lead.

00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:09.480
Thanks for coming all this way, Brooke.

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:11.271
- I owe you one.
- Happy to help, Mary.

00:14:11.274 --> 00:14:12.959
Just buy me a drink
later, we'll call it even.

00:14:12.961 --> 00:14:14.076
Done and done.

00:14:14.078 --> 00:14:15.628
Brooke, this is my son, Archie.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.940
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:18.651
So, you guys go way back, huh?

00:14:18.654 --> 00:14:21.282
We do. We met at Sarah Florence.

00:14:21.285 --> 00:14:22.724
We were roommates freshman year.

00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:25.787
So your mom tells me you're interested
in boxing for the Naval Academy.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.122
Uh, possibly.

00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:29.542
Well, the Academy's
physical education program

00:14:29.544 --> 00:14:31.961
requires all midshipmen
to participate in boxing,

00:14:31.963 --> 00:14:34.296
so you'll have plenty of competition.

00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:36.557
And as a member of the boxing club,

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.392
you train with the best.

00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:41.395
But the Academy also prepares
you for life outside the gym.

00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:43.639
Over four years, you
get a great education,

00:14:43.641 --> 00:14:45.658
a college degree, and a job.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.748
In the military?

00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:49.477
Upon graduation, you serve
five years active duty.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.680
By the time I'm finished,

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.999
my prime boxing years
might be behind me.

00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.668
Yeah, but that's why you need to
find something real to fall back on.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.984
And many of our boxers go on
to have professional careers.

00:14:58.987 --> 00:15:01.280
Our program is extremely competitive.

00:15:01.283 --> 00:15:03.751
I'd want to see you in the ring first.

00:15:03.753 --> 00:15:06.203
Well, Archie, I'm sure that you
can set up an exhibition match

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.496
so that Brooke can see what you can do.

00:15:07.498 --> 00:15:09.665
Yeah. Yeah, I can ask Fangs.

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:12.376
Great. Let's do this Friday evening?

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.625
We'll be there.

00:15:18.193 --> 00:15:19.433
Got IDs?

00:15:19.435 --> 00:15:21.769
Gotta be 18 or over to get inked.

00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:25.013
Actually, we were wondering if you, um,

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:26.774
recognized this?

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.229
Matter of fact, yeah.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.541
Kid came in asking for those
symbols a few weeks back.

00:15:34.543 --> 00:15:35.785
Did he mention why?

00:15:35.788 --> 00:15:38.068
Nah, just showed me the
design and paid cash.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.495
Just like the first guy.

00:15:39.497 --> 00:15:41.363
Wait. There was a first guy?

00:15:41.365 --> 00:15:44.334
Yeah, about a year ago, I gave that
same tattoo to a different dude.

00:15:44.337 --> 00:15:46.576
Same symbols, also on his back.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:49.371
Do you have a name?
Maybe a photo, by chance?

00:15:49.373 --> 00:15:50.782
Never ask for names.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.092
Normally, I like to take
photos of my finished work,

00:15:53.094 --> 00:15:55.303
but this guy would not let
a camera anywhere near him.

00:15:55.305 --> 00:15:56.670
No photos, huh?

00:15:56.672 --> 00:15:58.632
Sounds like someone that I know.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:00.525
What did he look like?

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:03.569
Sandy hair, blue eyes...

00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:05.238
Weirdly magnetic?

00:16:06.515 --> 00:16:07.956
That's the guy.

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:09.321
Mmm-hmm.

00:16:10.645 --> 00:16:12.491
Thanks.

00:16:12.494 --> 00:16:16.329
Evelyn told me what you've
been doing, Sister Cheryl.

00:16:16.332 --> 00:16:21.962
She said that you've been
campaigning for prom queen.

00:16:21.965 --> 00:16:23.572
Brother Edgar,

00:16:23.574 --> 00:16:26.384
think about what it would
mean if I were prom queen.

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:30.129
Standing on that stage,
a crown on my head...

00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:32.891
I could use that platform
to spread the Farm's message.

00:16:32.893 --> 00:16:34.667
Cheryl.

00:16:34.669 --> 00:16:36.418
Do you like being a
member of our community?

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.004
Yes, immensely.

00:16:39.006 --> 00:16:40.273
That is good.

00:16:42.443 --> 00:16:45.593
But standing with us...

00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:47.763
requires sacrifice.

00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:51.868
Now, if you can't let something
as trivial as prom queen go...

00:16:54.772 --> 00:16:58.633
I'm afraid we can't have you speaking
with your brother Jason any longer.

00:17:03.206 --> 00:17:05.715
I understand, and I'm done campaigning.

00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:10.303
Just please don't take Jason away.

00:17:12.413 --> 00:17:13.741
No question.

00:17:13.744 --> 00:17:17.392
This is a unique and
handsomely-maintained property, Ms. Lodge.

00:17:17.395 --> 00:17:19.294
I have no doubt your
loan will be approved.

00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:20.813
That's great. Thank you.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.208
Veronica.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.644
- Tell me you're not selling...
- Absolutely not, Pop.

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:30.267
I'm just looking to get a loan
to help Archie and his boxing gym.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.053
I thought you and Archie...

00:17:32.056 --> 00:17:33.641
We're just friends, Pop.

00:17:33.644 --> 00:17:36.329
Friends and business associates.

00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:52.661
You're over by six pounds.

00:17:52.663 --> 00:17:54.703
Sorry, but you're not fighting, kid.

00:17:57.084 --> 00:17:58.917
No, no, no. Commissioner.

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:00.836
I'll cut down. I'll make the weight.

00:18:00.838 --> 00:18:02.504
By Friday?

00:18:02.506 --> 00:18:04.698
- Good luck with that.
- Friday?

00:18:04.701 --> 00:18:06.434
I thought the fight was on Saturday.

00:18:06.436 --> 00:18:08.034
Last-minute change.

00:18:08.037 --> 00:18:10.512
The fight's at 4:00, but I can't
let you in the ring at this weight.

00:18:10.514 --> 00:18:11.474
I'll be there...

00:18:12.442 --> 00:18:13.816
minus six pounds.

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:19.688
Jug, the tattoo artist said
that a guy with blond hair

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.734
and blue eyes got a Gargoyle
King tattoo about a year ago,

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:26.195
right around the time
the Farm moved to town,

00:18:26.197 --> 00:18:29.457
and right before any of this
game stuff started to happen.

00:18:29.459 --> 00:18:33.202
Add the fact that my
mom just got a tattoo...

00:18:33.204 --> 00:18:36.121
per Mr. Evernever's request.

00:18:36.123 --> 00:18:37.673
Okay.

00:18:37.675 --> 00:18:39.568
But if the Gargoyle King is Edgar,

00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:43.228
then how does that explain your mom
seeing him during Ascension Night

00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:45.732
nearly two decades
before Edgar got to town?

00:18:45.734 --> 00:18:48.651
Who says that the new Gargoyle
King is the same person

00:18:48.653 --> 00:18:50.358
as the old one?

00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:53.554
My mom gave testimony to the
Farm about the Midnight Club.

00:18:53.557 --> 00:18:56.391
Edgar could have taken on that persona.

00:18:56.393 --> 00:18:58.778
I know that Edgar has been
messing with your family.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.062
Think about it.

00:19:00.064 --> 00:19:02.582
Edgar bought The Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

00:19:02.584 --> 00:19:04.417
where the game originated.

00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:08.996
Both he and the Gargoyle
King preached Ascension.

00:19:08.998 --> 00:19:11.615
Both of them have followers
that they manipulate,

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:14.177
and they're both really, really creepy.

00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:17.619
There's only one way to settle this...

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.475
and fast.

00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:24.128
I don't know if this is a cry for help

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.181
or if you need to seriously
refine your taste in athletic wear.

00:19:27.183 --> 00:19:29.216
I gotta lose weight
for this fight Friday.

00:19:29.218 --> 00:19:30.509
Are you sure that's enough time?

00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:31.927
I'll do it.

00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:33.854
Can you give me a ride back here after?

00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:35.281
I gotta focus in the car.

00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:36.557
Focus on what?

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:37.933
Another fight.

00:19:37.935 --> 00:19:41.120
My mom invited this
recruiter to come see me box.

00:19:41.122 --> 00:19:43.313
Archie, that's insane.

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.149
You can't fight twice in the same day.

00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:48.191
Just invite your mom and the
recruiter to the tournament.

00:19:49.113 --> 00:19:50.797
That's the thing.

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:53.049
My mom didn't sign that waiver, I did.

00:19:53.051 --> 00:19:54.331
I forged her signature.

00:19:54.334 --> 00:19:56.360
She doesn't want me to
fight in this tournament,

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:59.621
so much so that she brought this
recruiter all the way from Annapolis.

00:19:59.623 --> 00:20:01.974
- So...
- So you've got to give her a good show.

00:20:01.976 --> 00:20:03.959
I get it.

00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:06.121
And I'll make sure you
get back here in time.

00:20:07.649 --> 00:20:11.008
Many tribes, when their elders die,

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.467
would consume their bodies

00:20:12.469 --> 00:20:14.720
to absorb the wisdom.

00:20:14.722 --> 00:20:16.239
Very good question, Alice.

00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:19.933
Now, who's next?

00:20:19.935 --> 00:20:21.518
Me.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.355
How about you admit that
you are the Gargoyle King?

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:27.408
Edgar, I am so sorry.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.618
It's all right, Alice.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.321
Clearly, whatever is on Betty's mind

00:20:32.323 --> 00:20:33.822
must be very important.

00:20:33.824 --> 00:20:35.117
Why don't you join us?

00:20:36.869 --> 00:20:42.789
And we can unpack this obsession
you have with the Gargoyle King.

00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:44.999
I have a better idea.

00:20:45.002 --> 00:20:46.919
Why don't you take off your shirt?

00:20:46.921 --> 00:20:49.263
- Betty.
- I want to see your tattoos.

00:20:49.265 --> 00:20:50.314
I do have a tattoo.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.292
On my wrist.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.279
It's an infinity symbol,
just like many of us here.

00:20:56.281 --> 00:21:00.199
I'm talking about the runic
symbols that would be on your back.

00:21:00.201 --> 00:21:02.392
This is sublimation, Betty.

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:06.188
But I have nothing to hide.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.290
Then prove it.

00:21:30.543 --> 00:21:31.647
There.

00:21:33.008 --> 00:21:36.736
Does that satisfy you, Betty?

00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:38.947
Just a hair under the limit.

00:22:38.949 --> 00:22:41.041
Well done, Archie.

00:22:41.043 --> 00:22:43.327
Now let's get you to bout number one.

00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:49.951
Don't worry about it.

00:22:49.954 --> 00:22:53.354
It should be a relief that your mom's
not marrying a second serial killer.

00:22:57.819 --> 00:22:59.661
If not Edgar, then who?

00:22:59.664 --> 00:23:01.061
If we're gonna catch the Gargoyle King,

00:23:01.063 --> 00:23:02.679
it's going to be on his own terms.

00:23:04.734 --> 00:23:06.516
- His Gospel?
- Yes.

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:08.327
Now, I think that
there's a ritual in here

00:23:08.329 --> 00:23:10.687
that will help invoke
him. Just listen to this.

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:12.832
"After the false prophet is sacrificed,

00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:14.408
the shire will have a bacchanal

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.577
to celebrate the coronation
of the Gryphon Queen."

00:23:16.579 --> 00:23:18.663
Does that sound like any
imminent school event to you?

00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:19.903
Junior prom?

00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:23.366
"Upon her crowning, the Gryphon
Queen will ensure the King's arrival

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:24.868
by subjugating herself

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.054
and declaring that the one true monarch

00:23:27.056 --> 00:23:28.912
of Eldervair is the Gargoyle King."

00:23:28.915 --> 00:23:30.999
I'm assuming I'm the Gryphon
Queen in this scenario?

00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:34.020
Right. Ergo, we just have to ensure
that you're crowned prom queen.

00:23:34.022 --> 00:23:36.546
So, maybe we switch the prom theme

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.965
to something G&G-related.

00:23:38.967 --> 00:23:42.269
Assuming that the Gospel is, well,
gospel, he's going to show up.

00:23:42.271 --> 00:23:45.055
I mean, he's not going to
ignore his own rules, right?

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:47.891
And then we just need to ensure
that you're elected prom queen.

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.226
So what if we do all of that

00:23:49.228 --> 00:23:51.978
and the Gargoyle King
still doesn't materialize?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.232
Then the junior prom is just another
horrible mainstream school event

00:23:55.234 --> 00:23:56.266
that we'll have to endure.

00:23:57.335 --> 00:24:00.449
Speaking of which, who is the
chair of the prom committee?

00:24:02.392 --> 00:24:03.749
Hi, Cheryl.

00:24:03.752 --> 00:24:08.136
We had an idea that we
wanted to run by you.

00:24:08.139 --> 00:24:11.873
Now, we realize that our
prom's theme, Fire and Ice,

00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:13.334
was decided months ago.

00:24:13.337 --> 00:24:15.210
But frankly, people don't
know what that means.

00:24:15.212 --> 00:24:18.880
Right. So what if we specify
the theme a little bit?

00:24:18.889 --> 00:24:22.633
Maybe we call it something
like "The Renaissance,"

00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:24.428
or "Medieval Times."

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.323
Sure. Whatever.

00:24:27.325 --> 00:24:30.225
Cheryl, did you hear
anything we just said?

00:24:30.227 --> 00:24:32.766
Yes. And for all I care,

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:35.489
change the theme, make everyone
wear chainmail and corsets.

00:24:35.491 --> 00:24:36.749
Turn the photo booth into a pillory.

00:24:36.751 --> 00:24:38.741
Hand out turkey legs.

00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:41.184
What does it matter if
I'm not gonna be queen?

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:13.452
It was a great fight, Archie.

00:25:13.454 --> 00:25:15.270
You almost had him.

00:25:15.272 --> 00:25:17.998
One more round and I would've.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.876
I won't lose two fights in the same day.

00:25:20.878 --> 00:25:23.087
What, that exhibition fight with Fangs?

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.998
No, Archie.

00:25:25.001 --> 00:25:28.040
You are punch-drunk if you think I'm
gonna let you fight another match.

00:25:28.043 --> 00:25:29.784
You look like you were hit by a truck.

00:25:29.786 --> 00:25:32.177
Archie, you hobbled out of
that ring, dead on your feet.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.410
I'm fine, Veronica.

00:25:33.413 --> 00:25:36.499
I told my mom I'd be there. I
don't want to disappoint her.

00:25:36.502 --> 00:25:38.644
I'll get her and the
recruiter to reschedule.

00:25:38.646 --> 00:25:39.961
You can't. She's leaving.

00:25:39.963 --> 00:25:41.796
Then I'll get her to come back.

00:25:41.798 --> 00:25:44.400
My persistence is stronger
than your uppercut.

00:25:47.062 --> 00:25:48.821
I'll go first,

00:25:48.823 --> 00:25:51.740
and smooth out any ruffled feathers.

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:05.987
Veronica, where's Archie?

00:26:05.989 --> 00:26:08.290
Yeah, I'm going cold in here.

00:26:08.292 --> 00:26:11.034
Ms. Andrews, Counselor
Rivers, I presume.

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:12.753
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,

00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:14.755
but Archie is not gonna
be able to make it.

00:26:14.757 --> 00:26:16.039
What? Why not?

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.850
He's feeling under the weather.

00:26:17.852 --> 00:26:20.019
Since when? He was fine this morning.

00:26:20.021 --> 00:26:21.261
We think it's food poisoning.

00:26:21.263 --> 00:26:22.521
I'd love to reschedule.

00:26:22.523 --> 00:26:23.880
I can fight.

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.215
I can fight.

00:26:25.217 --> 00:26:26.975
I can still do this.

00:26:26.977 --> 00:26:29.069
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm fine.

00:26:30.597 --> 00:26:32.898
I'd like to show you what I got, ma'am.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.557
Fangs, you ready?

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.769
Yeah, let's do it.

00:26:45.862 --> 00:26:47.062
Archie!

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.912
Serpents, Poisons.

00:26:50.915 --> 00:26:52.198
We have a proposition for you.

00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:54.411
The Pretty Poisons don't
take orders from you.

00:26:54.413 --> 00:26:59.040
Please, Peaches. We're talking
about a prom night truce.

00:26:59.042 --> 00:27:02.426
So that we can all work together
to catch the Gargoyle King.

00:27:03.556 --> 00:27:04.831
How does that sound?

00:27:06.383 --> 00:27:08.049
The Poisons can get behind that.

00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:11.019
During prom, groups of you will
be stationed at every entrance.

00:27:11.021 --> 00:27:13.221
Once the announcement
for prom queen begins,

00:27:13.223 --> 00:27:15.724
you guys are gonna bar
anyone from exiting the gym.

00:27:15.726 --> 00:27:18.560
Whoever's cosplaying as the
Gargoyle King is going to be there,

00:27:18.562 --> 00:27:20.437
and this is going to be
our one shot at nabbing him.

00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:23.273
- Will he be in costume?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:25.900
At the minimum, he's gonna have
some sort of kingly signifier

00:27:25.902 --> 00:27:28.161
like a crown or antlers and the like,

00:27:28.163 --> 00:27:31.239
and he's going to make his move
after Betty is crowned prom queen.

00:27:31.241 --> 00:27:33.050
Let's end this nightmare...

00:27:33.836 --> 00:27:35.052
once and for all.

00:27:52.095 --> 00:27:53.637
Nice and slow.

00:27:53.639 --> 00:27:55.430
You took a fall there, kiddo.

00:27:55.432 --> 00:27:58.433
That's what happens when you try
to fight two matches in one day

00:27:58.435 --> 00:28:00.786
after starving yourself for a week.

00:28:03.198 --> 00:28:05.207
Where's Ronnie?

00:28:05.209 --> 00:28:07.050
I asked Veronica to give us some space

00:28:07.053 --> 00:28:09.169
so we can talk about what's
really going on with you.

00:28:10.573 --> 00:28:12.014
I shouldn't have double-booked.

00:28:12.017 --> 00:28:15.478
Yeah, and you shouldn't have
forged my signature and lied to me.

00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:17.831
Not to mention risking
your health, Archie.

00:28:17.834 --> 00:28:19.497
And to what end?

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.963
Mom, I want to be a boxer.

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:23.150
And you were so excited
about the recruiter

00:28:23.153 --> 00:28:25.459
that I wanted to give your way a shot.

00:28:25.462 --> 00:28:27.462
But I don't want to join the Navy.

00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:30.098
I don't want to go to college.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.059
It's a losing battle for me.

00:28:32.061 --> 00:28:35.887
I want to see how far these fists
can take me, and I want to fight.

00:28:35.889 --> 00:28:38.139
And you're 17 years old.

00:28:38.141 --> 00:28:39.566
You're thinking about tomorrow,

00:28:39.568 --> 00:28:41.648
I'm thinking about
the rest of your life.

00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:02.025
Hey, Pop.

00:29:02.028 --> 00:29:04.090
I'm closing La Bonne
Nuit early for the night.

00:29:04.093 --> 00:29:06.133
Most of my regulars will be at prom.

00:29:06.795 --> 00:29:08.687
- Veronica...
- What?

00:29:10.358 --> 00:29:11.857
What's going on, Pop?

00:29:11.859 --> 00:29:15.444
A few months back, I
found something out.

00:29:15.446 --> 00:29:17.366
Something I should have told you.

00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:20.637
You're gonna want to sit down for this.

00:29:43.632 --> 00:29:47.134
Well, shall we, my lady?

00:29:47.136 --> 00:29:48.769
Lead on, Hellcaster.

00:29:53.976 --> 00:29:56.268
You two want to vote for prom court?

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.528
How's the turnout been?

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.071
Lackluster.

00:29:59.073 --> 00:30:00.930
Luckily, you're running unopposed.

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:04.493
Still, we don't want any surprises.

00:30:08.774 --> 00:30:10.340
So far so good.

00:30:10.343 --> 00:30:12.842
I see the Serpents and
the Poisons are in place.

00:30:12.845 --> 00:30:15.129
Now we just wait for the
Gargoyle King to make his move.

00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:17.971
Mmm-hmm. And you'll take
him down when he does.

00:30:18.592 --> 00:30:20.175
I mean, imagine, Jug.

00:30:22.078 --> 00:30:24.249
He may be in this gym right now.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:30.343
You want to dance while we look for him?

00:30:30.345 --> 00:30:33.439
- Before your coronation, Your Majesty.
- Mmm. Yes.

00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:39.928
From the back-to-school dance

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.305
to the junior prom.

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:43.741
How much has changed.

00:30:45.736 --> 00:30:47.161
Some things are still the same.

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.247
True.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.458
Like my father.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.918
Hey, what's wrong?

00:30:56.205 --> 00:30:57.713
Before I came here tonight,

00:30:58.949 --> 00:31:01.449
Pop dropped a bombshell on me,

00:31:01.451 --> 00:31:04.118
and I'm still reeling.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.956
Apparently, I don't own the diner.

00:31:07.958 --> 00:31:09.883
My father does.

00:31:09.885 --> 00:31:11.376
And La Bonne Nuit, too.

00:31:11.378 --> 00:31:13.294
But you bought it from your dad.

00:31:13.296 --> 00:31:14.513
He tricked me.

00:31:14.515 --> 00:31:17.966
He gave me a fake deed
and kept the original.

00:31:17.968 --> 00:31:21.061
All this year, all this time,

00:31:21.063 --> 00:31:23.680
I've been working for my father.

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:27.493
Everything I've made, I
put back into the business,

00:31:27.495 --> 00:31:28.905
back into his pockets.

00:31:28.908 --> 00:31:30.228
Does he know that you know?

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.188
No.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.917
And I'm gonna act as
though nothing has changed.

00:31:34.919 --> 00:31:37.151
I'm gonna do exactly what he
would do in this situation,

00:31:37.153 --> 00:31:39.379
manipulate him into
digging his own grave.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.610
That's our way through this mess.

00:31:42.613 --> 00:31:43.926
"Our."

00:31:45.452 --> 00:31:47.870
I like hearing you say "our."

00:31:47.873 --> 00:31:49.833
- Reminds me of...
- The old days.

00:31:53.312 --> 00:31:54.861
Will you help me, Archie?

00:31:56.105 --> 00:31:59.406
And this time, we can take
down my father for good.

00:32:00.602 --> 00:32:02.083
Hell, yeah.

00:32:08.067 --> 00:32:11.685
I'm sorry you won't get
to be prom queen, babe.

00:32:11.688 --> 00:32:13.648
I know how important it was to you.

00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:15.873
It's okay, Tee-Tee.

00:32:17.193 --> 00:32:19.656
Edgar gave me something
better than a queenship.

00:32:20.622 --> 00:32:22.238
Humility.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.507
You can't mean that.

00:32:24.384 --> 00:32:26.700
No, you're right.

00:32:26.703 --> 00:32:28.795
I can't, and I don't.

00:32:28.797 --> 00:32:31.917
And suddenly, being a Farmie is
making a lot less sense to me.

00:32:37.906 --> 00:32:39.868
Are you the Gryphon Queen?

00:32:39.871 --> 00:32:41.512
This is for you.

00:32:43.571 --> 00:32:44.611
Who sent this?

00:32:45.722 --> 00:32:47.163
I got it from a Druid,

00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:50.325
who got it from a Centaur,
who got it from someone else.

00:32:57.524 --> 00:33:00.159
"To Her Majesty, the Gryphon Queen.

00:33:00.162 --> 00:33:03.496
You've been summoned to the place where
the first Ascension Night was held.

00:33:03.498 --> 00:33:04.676
Come alone.

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:08.733
Tell anyone, and every reveler attending
the festival tonight will pay the price."

00:33:28.264 --> 00:33:32.567
Good evening, Riverdale
Renaissance Revelers.

00:33:32.569 --> 00:33:37.814
At long last, it's time to
announce this year's court.

00:33:37.816 --> 00:33:41.226
And the winner of prom queen...

00:33:42.445 --> 00:33:44.463
is Betty Cooper.

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:52.915
Is Betty here?

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:00.129
Hey, have either of you seen Betty?

00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:03.375
Not gonna happen.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.693
I did what you asked.

00:35:31.574 --> 00:35:32.988
I came here alone.

00:35:37.727 --> 00:35:38.869
What do you want?

00:35:42.742 --> 00:35:43.890
Who are you?

00:36:13.596 --> 00:36:15.637
Dad?

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.961
Why are you doing this?

00:36:25.534 --> 00:36:27.367
Dad, you don't want to do this.

00:36:41.975 --> 00:36:43.725
Somebody help me!

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:37.088
Betty? It's Jug.

00:38:40.743 --> 00:38:42.761
Did you see him? Did you see him?

00:38:42.763 --> 00:38:44.095
- Who, the Gargoyle King?
- No!

00:38:44.097 --> 00:38:47.220
The Black Hood. The
Black Hood is back, Jug.

00:38:54.686 --> 00:38:56.526
It was a setup, Jug.

00:38:59.396 --> 00:39:03.097
The Gospel that we found,
and the Proclamation,

00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:05.766
it was all to get me
alone with my dad again.

00:39:05.768 --> 00:39:07.601
I can't believe none
of us saw it coming,

00:39:07.603 --> 00:39:08.936
the return of the Black Hood.

00:39:08.938 --> 00:39:10.813
Now we have two serial
killers running around.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:12.572
Possibly working together.

00:39:12.575 --> 00:39:14.495
And both of them outsmarting us.

00:39:24.787 --> 00:39:27.413
It's really horrible,
what happened at the dance.

00:39:27.415 --> 00:39:30.308
I can't believe we were all in
the gym while that was going on.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.386
I'm gonna stay in Riverdale
a little longer, Archie.

00:39:33.388 --> 00:39:35.296
I don't want you alone
while your dad's away.

00:39:35.298 --> 00:39:37.056
Okay.

00:39:37.058 --> 00:39:38.898
That's great, Mom.

00:39:40.895 --> 00:39:43.738
I'm gonna go for a run, if that's cool.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.683
You're really committed to
this, aren't you? To boxing?

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:51.082
Well, I tried music. I tried football.

00:39:51.085 --> 00:39:52.831
Well, the world is such a scary place.

00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:55.524
Maybe it's not the worst
thing to know how to fight.

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.406
To be able to defend yourself.

00:39:58.196 --> 00:39:59.367
Do you mean that?

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.831
If this is your path,

00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.649
I want to support it.

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.177
And you.

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:07.679
As long as you do it right.

00:40:07.681 --> 00:40:09.422
I promise, Mom.

00:40:09.424 --> 00:40:11.975
No more crash diets, double-bookings.

00:40:13.836 --> 00:40:15.343
Will you help me convince Dad?

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.934
- Mom.
- Betty?

00:40:22.937 --> 00:40:25.096
- What are you doing here?
- Mom, listen to me.

00:40:25.098 --> 00:40:27.991
I was right. Dad escaped.

00:40:27.993 --> 00:40:29.484
He's back. I saw him.

00:40:29.486 --> 00:40:30.943
No, they confirmed he's dead.

00:40:30.945 --> 00:40:32.520
No, he survived.

00:40:32.522 --> 00:40:35.948
He chased me during prom.
He's killing people again.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.691
No, Betty, no. I left that all behind.

00:40:37.693 --> 00:40:40.119
Mom, you have to deal with this.

00:40:40.121 --> 00:40:42.738
Dad is back, and I think
he's coming here next.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.779
What?

00:40:43.782 --> 00:40:45.073
Why would he come here?

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:47.034
'Cause I told him about
your engagement to Edgar

00:40:47.036 --> 00:40:48.720
and how he plans to adopt the twins,

00:40:48.722 --> 00:40:49.995
and he was really upset.

00:40:49.997 --> 00:40:51.747
Why were you talking to that monster?

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.891
Because he fooled me!

00:40:53.894 --> 00:40:54.976
What do we do?

00:40:56.212 --> 00:40:57.625
You stay here.

00:41:01.092 --> 00:41:03.217
Our walls are strong, Betty.

00:41:03.219 --> 00:41:05.653
And our members stronger.

00:41:05.655 --> 00:41:08.323
Let the Farm protect you. Both of you.

00:41:11.352 --> 00:41:12.652
Will you stay?

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.784
Yeah.

00:41:26.437 --> 00:41:29.714
